        from ptrace man page, "execve(2) under ptrace":
            When  one  thread  in  a multithreaded process calls execve(2), the kernel destroys all other threads in the
            process, and resets the thread ID of the execing thread to the thread group ID (process ID).   (Or,  to  put
            things another way, when a multithreaded process does an execve(2), at completion of the call, it appears as
            though the execve(2) occurred in the thread group leader, regardless of which  thread  did  the  execve(2).)
            This resetting of the thread ID looks very confusing to tracers: 
                [...]
                *   The  execing  tracee  changes  its  thread ID while it is in the execve(2).  (Remember, under ptrace, the
                    "pid" returned from waitpid(2), or fed into ptrace calls, is the  tracee's  thread  ID.)   That  is,  the
                    tracee's  thread  ID  is  reset  to  be the same as its process ID, which is the same as the thread group
                    leader's thread ID.
                *   Then a PTRACE_EVENT_EXEC stop happens, if the PTRACE_O_TRACEEXEC option was turned on.
        So, we should not insert the ptrace_event value, but the current_pid, as by the time we (the tracer)
        see this event, the PID has already been changed.

/*
Because wait() will return the same PID for any of a process's threads, we need a way to get the thread ID so that we can keep track of entering/exiting.
Though the only reason we need to keep track of that is to not double-print. Can we just check whether the to-be-printed values are the same as the last ones?
Maybe yes, but it would be nice to be able to keep track of that, period. And what if two threads with the same PID enter the same syscall before either exits?
Then we'll only print once. Need linked list to keep track of syscalls that have entered but not exited? Would solve the problem of syscalls getting interrupted
before exiting, which happens. Context switching? But wouldn't solve the problem of two threads with the same PID that enter the same syscall before either exits.
But if that happens, there will just be "one on the stack twice" instead of "two on the stack once". Is that a problem?

What's happening with unseen PIDs: we are informed of a process entering a clone syscall, and before it exits, the new thread is scheduled and starts executing its own syscalls,
which we are informed of. Eventually followed by the original clone exiting, so does get inserted into map.

TODO: maybe still haven't accounted for this:
    If the thread group leader has reported its PTRACE_EVENT_EXIT stop by this time, it appears to the tracer
    that  the  dead  thread  leader "reappears from nowhere".  (Note: the thread group leader does not report
    death via WIFEXITED(status) until there is at least one other live thread.  This eliminates the possibil‐
    ity that the tracer will see it dying and then reappearing.)  If the thread group leader was still alive,
    for the tracer this may look as if thread group leader returns from  a  different  system  call  than  it
    entered,  or even "returned from a system call even though it was not in any system call".  If the thread
    group leader was not traced (or was traced by a different tracer), then during execve(2) it  will  appear
    as if it has become a tracee of the tracer of the execing tracee.
